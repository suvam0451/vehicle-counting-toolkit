### Completed

- Video slicig, image extraction
- Frame-by-frame classification and storing the data
- Processing the data to get vehicle trajectories
- Removing false positives
- Simple object tracking

### Pending (Code)

- Possible **improvements to object tracking** (Currently using a simple approach)
- Handling **parked vehicles**
- Read up papers on extrapolating horizontal extent from images (used for **relative speed**)

### Pending (Report)

- Either get a pre-existing vehicle **tally database** or manually do the counting (for intersections) and run comparisions
- Append statistical **graphs of speeds, volume** and for a single ideal road for an extended amount of time.

### Planned (Not relevant to report)

- **Package the code** with the Image processing GUI app I created for BTP-2
- Documentation for tooling, so that someone else may find it's use.

### Previous project

- Graphical interface (BTP-2)

MTP-I report

## 1. Motivation

4-5 slides -> Bullet points with meaningful
2 page writeup -> section/subsection

# 2. Objective/Scope of work

Key activities to consider. Major form. Gross activities
Summary of what i am trying to acheive
Scope of eowkr: Broad thing need ot do

# 3. Literature review

How I am picking a technique, relevant work that has been done
Classification of papers
Summary of literature review : Context of work

# 4. Methodology

Method of doing the work
Algorithms
Flow chart
Already done in MTP-I, MTP-II

# 5. Database

How I got data. Describe data points we have, length of videos.

# 6. Summary and Conclusion

# 7. References

# Output

Program outputs the data --> Classified volume count, Speed, Demarcate the lane
